    <p>Vaquita, the world's rarest marine mammal, is on the edge of extinction in Mexico, with only about 10 remaining. This little guy wasn't discovered until 1958 and a little over half a century later, we are on the brink of losing them forever. Due to llegal fishing. </p>

    <p> The Vaquita has a large dark ring around its eyes and dark patches on its lips that form a thin line from the mouth to the pectoral fins. Its top the dorsal surface is dark gray, its sides are pale gray, and its underside the ventral surface is white with long, light gray markings.</p>

<p>The Newborn vaquita have darker coloration and a wide gray fringe of color that runs from the head to the flukes, passing through the dorsal and pectoral fins. They are most often found close to shore in the Gulf's shallow waters, although they quickly swim away if a boat approaches.</p>
